      question: "Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer?",
      answer:
        "Good question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level designer now exceeds $100,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one available). Aside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all times, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to utilize.",

    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?",
      answer:
        "Once subscribed, you're able to add as many design requests to your queue as you'd like, and they will be delivered one by one.",
    },
    {
      question: "How fast will I receive my designs?",
      answer:
        "On average, most requests are completed in just two days or less. However, more complex requests can take longer.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who are the designers?",
      answer:
        "You might be surprised to hear this, but Designpro is actually an agency of one. This means you'll work directly with me, founder of Designpro.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the pause feature work?",
      answer:
        "We understand you may not have enough design work to fill up entire month. Perhaps you only have one or two design requests at the moment. That's where pausing your subscription comes in handy.",
